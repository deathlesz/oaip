Yeah, this code is not exactly good (i hate it with passion).
All of this was written just to please weird and inhumane standards of our ~~beloved~~ most hated teacher, for a lack of better words.

Topics roughly go as follows:
1. Branching
2. Loops
3. Static arrays
4. 2D arrays (matrices)
5. Dynamic arrays
6. Sorting
7. Strings

This repository will be updated every time I overcome my genuine hatred. Best of luck to whoever wishes to read my code <3
